# Apropri-fpgrowth

The Apriori Algorithm is commonly used for frequent pattern mining, and FP-growth is an upgraded version of it (AKA Association Rule Mining). It's an analytical technique for identifying common patterns or correlations in data sets.

Han proposed the FP-Growth Algorithm, which is an efficient and scalable method for mining the entire set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth, which uses an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed and crucial information about frequent patterns called the frequent-pattern tree.
